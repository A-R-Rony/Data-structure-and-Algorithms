//Creating a Build System
Open Sublime Text editor and then go to Tools > Build System > New Build System.
Paste the following code in the file and save it.
Name the file as “CP.sublime-build“.
{
    "cmd": ["g++.exe", "-std=c++17", "${file}",
            "-o", "${file_base_name}.exe",
            "&&", "${file_base_name}.exe<inputf.in>outputf.out"],
    "shell":true,
    "working_dir":"$file_path",
    "selector":"source.cpp"
}
The above block of code is used for taking input from the file “inputf.in” and prints the output to “outputf.out”.

Setting up the Window Layout
Create three new files as shown below and make sure all of them are in the same folder.

file.cpp: The file for writing the code.
inputf.in: The file where we will be giving the input.
outputf.out: The file where the output will be displayed.

Now, perform the following steps:

Select View > Layout > Columns : 3. This will create three columns in the workspace. Move the three files into three columns.
Select View > Groups > Max Columns : 2.
Select the build system we just created from Tools > Build System > CP.
